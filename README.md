## Main used technologies:

Express.js

## Instructions to utilize the application
After cloning the repository, you need to install the necessary dependencies with the `npm install` command and start the project with the `node index.js` command. After that, you can make requests using an HTTP client (Insomnia, Postman, HTTPie, etc.).
